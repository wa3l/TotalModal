TotalModal
=======
An easy to use jQuery plugin to handle notification boxes and confirmation boxes (i.e. with buttons), it let's you easily ceate notification boxes that disappear after a timeout or upon a click event, or you can add buttons and have actions associated with clicking them.

Disclaimer: This is based on a plugin called jquery.confirm and some other code, I only improved and added features to the original plugin.
